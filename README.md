# Background:

In order to make typing on a mobile device quick and easy, an autocomplete

feature is commonly implemented to try to guess what word a user wishes to type

before they are finished. Such a feature requires extensive use of search

algorithms. Here, you will be building the backend of an autocomplete engine

(i.e., you won't gathering any user input).



## Specifications:

* The default class is `./app/src/main/java/cs1501_p2/App.java`. The provided

  `App.java` simply provides the autocomplete engine with a few characters and

  prints out the predictions generated. In order to get this running, you will

  first need download a copy of the English dictionary that you will use for

  this project from

  [here](http://people.cs.pitt.edu/~nlf4/cs1501/handouts/dictionary.txt) and

  place it in your `./app/src/main/resources/` folder. Placing it here will

  make it available to your programs via the relative path

  `build/resources/main/dictionary.txt` when you run `./gradlew run`.

	* **Do not** add this file to your git repository, however! (i.e.,

		**do not** run `git add dictionary.txt`).

	* Note that Gradle will automatically copy this file to

		`./app/build/resources/main/` when you run `./gradlew run` (hence

		why the path to read this file is

		`"build/resources/main/dictionary.txt"` in `App.java`.  A similar thing

		is done for `./gradlew test`, moving from

		`./app/src/test/resources/dictionary.java` to

		`./app/build/resources/test/`.

	* Also note that the provided testing dictionary is much smaller than this

		one.


* In order to get your project to actually compile and run, however, you will

  need to implement 3 classes:

  	* `DLB` in `./app/src/main/java/cs1501_p2/DLB.java` which implements

	  `Dict`

	* `UserHistory` in `./app/src/main/java/cs1501_p2/UserHistory.java` which

	  also implements `Dict`

	* `AutoCompleter` in `./app/src/main/java/cs1501_p2/AutoCompleter.java`

	  which implements `AutoComplete_Inter`.


* For `DLB`, you must implement a De La Briandais (DLB) trie data structure (as 

  described in lecture) to use in your project. This class will be used to

  store the dictionary of English words.`DLB` must be all your own code (e.g.,

  you cannot use the Java LinkedList, you must implement your own linked-list).

  You must use the `DLBNode` defined in

  `./app/src/main/java/cs1501_p2/DLBNode.java` to construct the DLB. You cannot

  modify `DLBNode.java`. You must implement all of the methods of `Dict` as

  defined in `Dict.java`, specifically:


	* `public void add(String key);`

	* `public boolean contains(String key);`

	* `public boolean containsPrefix(String pre);`

	* `public int searchByChar(char next);`

	* `public void resetByChar();`

	* `public ArrayList<String> suggest();`

	* `public ArrayList<String> traverse();`

	* `public int count();`


  For descriptions of what these methods should do, refer to the JavaDoc

  comments in `Dict.java`. `DLB` must return the results of `suggest()` in

  ascending order by their character value ("ASCIIbetical" order).


  This class must be all your own code. You cannot use any code from the

  textbook authors or the JCL in constructing the DLB. The only exception is

  tha tyou can use an ArrayList to construct the return values for `suggest()`

  and `traverse()`.


* `UserHistory` will be used to keep track of what words the user has actually

  selected, and how many times that word has been selected. For `UserHistory`,

  you are free to use whatever approach you choose to implement `Dict`. You are

  free to use any JCL classes or code provided by the textbook authors to

  implement `UserHistory`. Your implementation of `UserHistory` *must* have the

  same **worst-case** asymptotic runtime for all operations as the DLB (as

  described in lecture). Further, as an additional requirement, `UserHistory`'s

  implementation of `suggest()` must produce up to 5 words that the user has most

  frequently selected based off of the given prefix (in order). E.g., if the user

  has selected "free" 5 times in the past, "frequent" 3 times, and "frustration"

  1 time in the past, after entering 'f', then 'r', `suggest()` should return

  an ArrayList containing "free", "frequent", then "frustration".


* `AutoCompleter` will bring all of this together to form the API of your

  autocomplete engine. First, you will need to have a constructor that accepts

  2 String filenames. The first is the name of a file containing the English

  dictionary, the second the name of a file containing saved user history 

  information. You should also implement an overloaded constructor that

  supports only the first argument (the English language dictionary). Both of

  these constructors should create `DLB` and `UserHistory` objects as

  attributes of `AutoCompleter` (in the case of the latter constructor, the

  `UserHistory` object will be empty).


  There are 3 methods defined in `AutoComplete_Inter`. For `finishWord()`, be

  sure to reset the state of any searches and update the user history

  attribute to reflect the word selected. Note that it may not be based on the

  current search! E.g., you should support the calls:


  	* `.nextChar('a')`

  	* `.nextChar('b')`

  	* `.nextChar('c')`

	* `.finishWord("word")`


  For `saveUserHistory()`, you are free to adopt whatever approach you want

  for saving the state of the `UserHistory` object to a file. The save file

  does not need to be a text file or human-readable. Saving and loading the

  user history should have a O(n) runtime (where n is the number of distinct

  words in the `UserHistory` object). **Do not** add any user history save

  state files to your repository!



### Example `App.java` run

```



## Additional Notes:

* Note that if your user history predictions contain a word that is also

  contained in the dictionary predictions, this word should not be presented

  as a suggestion to the user twice in the same prompt (e.g., the final list

  of predictions in the example above).


* Your program should run in a case-sensitive manner in order to allow for

  easier prediction of proper nouns and acronyms.


* Don't forget to make all of your source files a part of the package 

  `cs1501_p2`!


* The default file to run is `App.java`, you can execute this by running

  `./gradlew run` on Linux or macOS.


* There a number of tests for your classes in

  `./app/src/test/java/cs1501_p2/AllTest.java`. Running `./gradlew test` on

  Linux or macOS will run these tests.


* As always, note that we will be grading your project using different tests

  than those that appear in `./app/src/test`. You are encouraged to write your

  own tests to help ensure that your project is working as specified.
