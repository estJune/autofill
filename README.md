# Background:

In order to make typing on a mobile device quick and easy, an autocomplete

feature is commonly implemented to try to guess what word a user wishes to type

before they are finished. Such a feature requires extensive use of search

algorithms. Here, you will be building the backend of an autocomplete engine

(i.e., you won't gathering any user input).
